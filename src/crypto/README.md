# Cryptography Concepts and Programs

This directory contains various implementations and notes related to cryptography concepts. The programs included here demonstrate fundamental cryptographic algorithms and techniques.

## Contents

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Implementations of symmetric key algorithms such as AES and DES.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Implementations of asymmetric key algorithms such as RSA and ECC.
- **Hash Functions**: Examples of cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 and MD5.
- **Digital Signatures**: Implementations demonstrating the creation and verification of digital signatures.
- **Key Management**: Notes and examples related to key generation, storage, and management practices.

## Usage

To run the cryptography programs, ensure you have Java installed and configured on your machine. You can compile and execute the Java files using the following commands:

```bash
javac <filename>.java
java <filename>
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the Java file you wish to run.

## Notes

- Ensure to follow best practices for security when implementing cryptographic algorithms.
- Refer to the documentation of each algorithm for a deeper understanding of its workings and applications.

Feel free to add your own implementations and notes as you explore more about cryptography!
