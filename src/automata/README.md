# Automata Theory Concepts and Programs

This directory contains various programs and documentation related to Automata Theory. Automata Theory is a fundamental area of computer science that deals with the study of abstract machines and the problems they can solve.

## Contents

- **Finite Automata**: Programs and explanations related to finite state machines, including deterministic and non-deterministic automata.
- **Regular Expressions**: Implementation and examples of regular expressions and their relation to finite automata.
- **Context-Free Grammars**: Documentation and programs that explore context-free languages and their corresponding automata.
- **Turing Machines**: Concepts and implementations related to Turing machines, including their significance in computability theory.

## Usage

To run the programs in this directory, ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can compile and run the Java files using the following commands:

```bash
javac <ProgramName>.java
java <ProgramName>
```

Replace `<ProgramName>` with the name of the Java file you wish to execute.

## Contribution

Feel free to add your own programs and documentation related to Automata Theory. Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and best practices.
